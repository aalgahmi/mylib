A simple package with a couple of machine learning functions and classes to be used in my ML courses.

## Installation
To use this package in a Jupyter notebook:

* Open a terminal window and change its current directory to where your notebook is. For example:
  ```
  cd handouts
  ```
  
  Notice that can launch a terminal from inside Jupyter Lab using the menu **File/New/Terminal**.
* Run the following command to download this package (clone it) from GitHub:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/aalgahmi/mylib.git
  ```

If all your notebooks are in one folder, then this will only need to be done once. After that, you can import this package using a statement like this:

``` python
import mylib as my
```
